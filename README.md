# weather-app

This app is meant to be the foundation of a project you can slowly expand and grow. We would like to start with a command line tool but it should be modular, so that it can eventually expand to a full fledged web application.

### Requirements

You are to build a command line tool that pulls a city from a configuration file and displays the cities next 7 day forecast. The more details about the forecast you put in the better. It will all be run and displayed in the command line for now.

You will need to use a [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the weather data. You do not have to use the one I linked this is just an example. 

The goal of this project is just to the first stages of a full fledged weather app. When building and designing the application keep in mind you want every component to be reusable. Ideally you would want the design to be [object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#:~:text=Object%2Doriented%20programming%20(OOP),(often%20known%20as%20methods).).

When designing classes ask yourself what is this components job and does it do only its job? You don't want a "display" module that is made just to print the data to the screen to also be fetching the weather! Keep different jobs seperated!

### Contributing

You need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo [create your own branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) once your done and ready for me to look over your code.

### Tips

google. google. google. I provided a few links to get you started but if you do not know how to do something google it. The best way to learn is by doing.

Don't know what an API is? google it.

Don't know how to use an API in python? google it.

Don't know hwo to read from a file? google it.

I have provided some skeleton code. This is one way to structure the project. You are not restricted to this. I would reccomend not looking at the skeleton code unless you are stuck.

### Future work

Once done with this we can talk about how this project can be expanded. 

*note you do not need to use python but I think it would be the easiest and I would reccomend it
